I am a machine learning enthusiast and with a special interest in image recognition.

Someone who enjoys learning for the sake of it, I get high on good music and great jam sessions, playing and collecting different musical instruments, electronics, react.js, Node.js, Unity VR development and of course machine learning.

I regularly write on medium about basic concepts in Machine Leanring visit: [https://medium.com/@prateekkarkare]

If you have suggestions to good music, great learning material on any of the above feel free to drop me a DM on twitter, linkedin or any of the blog posts here!
